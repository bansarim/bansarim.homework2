     <p> 
      My name is Bansari. I am a biomedical Engineer. I finished my studies from university of Ottawa. I am learning to coding in order to add a skill to my resume as well as career change.I would like to work as front end java developer
       I have Underwent six weeks of internship covering the Radiology department and Operation theatre. Worked on the technical details of several medical devices from therapeutic, Immunology, urology, histopathology and neurology departments
       followed by preparing a report on device specification and maintenance schedules. Further, I was able to assist biomedical engineers in calibration, servicing contracts and repairs of several biomedical modalities. 
       I was even offered a chance to write up the standard operation procedures (SOPâ€™S) of all the major medical equipment across the above-mention department of the hospital to be submitted to the medical superintendent.
